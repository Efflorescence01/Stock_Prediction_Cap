### Project Overview 
  This is a data analysis & machine learning project for stock trading and investing. It is focused on the S&P 500 index and the companies within that index during the period from 2010 to the present year (2024). This project will utilize Juypterlab/Notebook to perform data cleaning, data analysis, and modeling. The language of choice will be Python. We will also be using data science-related libraries such as matplotlib, pandas, NumPy, and Scikitlearn. As a stock trading enthusiast, I started this project to improve my skills and knowledge in data analysis regarding stock data. Previously, I only worked with simple statistical terms such as averages, and maximum and minimum values. As such,I wanted a more granular perspective of stock data to improve my analysis of my trades and thus increase my earnings and win rate.Individuals/businesses engaged in investing or trading activities may obtain some insight from this project.
